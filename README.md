#Day 27 assignment --Twitter Clone

##Planning Process
1. When beginning this assignment, I sketched out all of my wireframes.
2. Each wireframe represented a "view" and was assigned a route.
3. For each view, I wrote out the user events that it handled and considered any additional custom functions I'd have to add.

##Building Process
1. I began building my router as this helps me see all the views I will eventually want my user to access.
2. I moved on to login and sign up functionality. I had some troubleshooting issues with unsetting the password once the user logged in or signed up.
3. After completing those, I created my navigation where my logout function lives. I debated the best place for this but it is currently placed on my router even though it is part of the navigation view.
4. Building the tweet feed was my next step. I had to do some troubleshooting to render the children to the parent ul.
5. I built the user specificity to edit and delete your own tweets.

##Problems
1. Editing is not functional as I had trouble getting the specific tweet to edit from the server.
2. Local storage still needs to be built
3. Minimal styling due to time constraint
